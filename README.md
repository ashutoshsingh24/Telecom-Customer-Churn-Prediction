# 📊 Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

### 🔍 Description
This project uses machine learning models (SVM, KNN, Random Forest, Decision Tree) to predict customer churn in the telecom industry. It analyzes customer usage patterns and service data to forecast whether a customer is likely to leave the service

## 📌 Overview
Customer churn is a major concern in the telecom industry as acquiring new users is far costlier than retaining existing ones. This project builds a predictive model using various ML algorithms to identify customers likely to churn based on their service usage and behavior data.

The goal is to help telecom companies reduce churn rates and improve customer satisfaction through proactive strategies.
